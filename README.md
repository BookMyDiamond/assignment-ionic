## Building a Virtual Scrolling Web Application using Ionic Framework and React

In this assignment, you will build a web application using [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs) and React that fetches data from a REST API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) and implements virtual scrolling to improve performance. 

---

#### Requirements:

-   The home page should display a list of posts returned by the [API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/).
-   Implement virtual scrolling to improve the performance of the list when scrolling through large numbers of items. (you can follow [this](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/virtual-scroll))
-   Clicking on a post should display a detailed view of the post including comments. [comments](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments).
-   The application should have at least two pages: one for the list view and one for the detailed view.
-   Use modern coding practices, such as component-based architecture and asynchronous programming.
-   Use [react hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react) and functional components where possible.
-  Use [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) or redux for state management if necessary.

----

#### Deliverables:

-   A working web application that meets the requirements listed above.
-   A README.md file that includes instructions for running the application, a description of the application's features, and any additional information that you think is relevant.
-   Bonus points for additional features or creative implementations.
